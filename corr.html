With the availability of genomic data on large cohorts of well-phenotyped individuals, there has been an increased interest in "genetic correlations" between traits. 
That is, when testing a genetic variants for association with two traits, are the effects of these genetic variants on the two traits correlated? 
</p>
<p>
These are now simple, easy-to-use software packages for calculating
these genetic correlations (<a
href="https://github.com/bulik/ldsc">e.g.</a>), and it is now clear
that many traits show some evidence for genetic correlation. For
example, the personality trait "neuroticism" is genetically correlated
to major depressive disorder, and cognitive performance (formerly
known as "IQ") is negatively genetically correlated to BMI.

</p> 

<p>
How can we interpret these results? Quantative geneticists have known
for a long time that genetic correlations arise for a variety of
related reasons. It is tempting to see the genetic correlations found
by GWAS approaches as side-stepping these issues. Indeed if done well
they can indeed by-pass the shared environment concerns that always
dogged family-based assessments of genetic correlations. However, the
deeper issue that genetic correlations can arise through parental
effects and assortative mating we believe has perhaps not gone away.

We start with the two most commonly-interpretations (putting aside obvious technical artifacts like shared population statification), and then discuss two additional possibilities, rarely directly tested, that merit further investigation.

[show causal diagrams for all of these]
</p>
<p>
1. Pleiotropy. For example, age at menarche and male pattern baldness.
</p>

<p>
2. Causality. For example, LDL and heart disease are postively genetically correlated.
</p>

GRAHAM:So I'm always confused by this distinction. I see pleiotropy
simply that alleles affect multiple traits. Some distinctions of
pleiotropy say affect unrelated traits. But to my mind that unrelated
is just a statement of ignorance. E.g. your AAM \& baldness are very
related traits if we view both as being hormonal. See here for some discussion:
http://www.genetics.org/content/186/3/767.full
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3558540/
to my mind causality is just a subset of pleitropy, but perhaps I'm
misunderstanding something. It's also not obvious that these are
distinct, when I factor in many variants (e.g. a genomes worth). E.g. do all
LDL variants in the genome increase heart-disease, or only the subset
of strongest SNPs we've looked at to date? E.g. does a variant that makes me more likely
to exercise impact heart disease only via LDL or can it affect both traits? If I have heart diesase
am I more careful about my LDL, so that all heart diease SNPS are LDL
SNPs (if LDL is measured throughout life) but what differs is the
strength of the effect size. All these things are present in genetic
correlations to my mind.

JOE: yes good point, that's a bit sloppy. some people call these things "mediated pleiotropy" and "biological pleiotropy", e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4104202/ Not sure if that's become standard in the field or if there's some better nomenclature. Re: LDL and heart disease, I think the prediction is that all LDL variants in the genome increase heart disease risk, though it's true we're only looked at the top hits.


These two explanations of a genetic correlation are of course plausible. 

Note that the pleiotropy we see as quantitative geneticists can be
mediated through environmental effects. It is simply a statement that
alleles affect multiple traits, not that those shared effects have
simple "molecular" basis.  

Some other models also seem quite plausible; the relative importance of these different models remains to be seen. 
<p>
3. Parental effects. For example, imagine that having a depressed
parent increases the "neuroticism" of their children.
This would be detected as a genetic correlation, though the causal connection between the variant and the two traits is less direct than in the previous two situations. 
Example: folate levels and neural tube defects? NICE EG. WE COULD ALSO
INCLUDE ONE (e.g. made up) THAT'S more obviously mediated through the
parental external environment.

</p>

<p>
4. Assortative mating. For example, imagine individuals with higher IQ tend to
marry individuals with lower BMI. This induces a genetic correlation
between the traits, even if there is no 
What is happening is that the alleles that are associated with both
traits co-occur in the same individuals (the offspring of these
assortative mating parents). This is a form of linkage disequibrium
between the loci underlying the same traits (even if the loci are not
genetically linked). If assortative mating
continues over multiple generations this effect can build to an
equilibrium level of genetic correlation between the two traits (Crow
and Kimura).

This is perhaps the most worrying of the causes for a genetic
correlation, in that in this case there is no causal connection
between the variant and both traits.
GRAHAM: Mostly agrees, but also playing devils avocado thinks that on some level that these
might not be any more spurious than some of the others, given that all of the causality of the others can arise due to
individuals associating with particular environments. 
</p>

How to determine the relative contributions of these latter two causes of genetic correlation? 
Family studies could help.
GRAHAM say: there was a height study you tweeted that did this.
Also would be useful to have some theory about what parameter regimes could potentially lead to signals; this could be compared to observations in humans. 

Note that while we have explained all of these effects in terms of
genetic covariance, they can also contribute to inflating the additive
genetic variance contributed by a trait. For example, couples
assortative mate by height, therefore, alleles contributing to tallness tend to be present
in taller individuals even more than we would predict from their
'true' effect size. Therefore, the effect sizes of alleles may be
mildly overestimated by this effect.
