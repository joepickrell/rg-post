With the availability of genomic data on large cohorts of well-phenotyped individuals, there has been an increased interest in "genetic correlations" between traits. 
That is, when testing a genetic variants for association with two traits, are the effects of these genetic variants on the two traits correlated? 
</p>
<p>
These are now simple, easy-to-use software packages for calculating these genetic correlations (<a href="https://github.com/bulik/ldsc">e.g.</a>), and it is now clear that many traits show some evidence for genetic correlation. 
For example, the personality trait "neuroticism" is genetically correlated to major depressive disorder, and cognitive performance (formerly known as "IQ") is negatively genetically correlated to BMI.

<p>
How can we interpret these results? 
We start with the two most commonly-interpretations (putting aside obvious technical artifacts like shared population statification), and then discuss two additional possibilities, rarely directly tested, that merit further investigation.

1. Pleiotropy. For example, age at menarche and male pattern baldness.
</p>

<p>
2. Causality. For example, LDL and heart disease are postively genetically correlated.
</p>

These two explanations of a genetic correlation are of course plausble. 
Some other models also seem quite plausible; the relative importance of these different models remains to be seen. 
<p>
3. Parental effects. For example, imagine that having a depressed parent increases the "neuroticism" of their children. This would be detected as a genetic correlation, though the causal connection between the variant and the two traits is less direct than in the previous two situations. 
Example: folate levels and neural tube defects?
</p>

<p>
4. Assortative mating. For example, imagine individuals with higher IQ tend to marry individuals with lower BMI. i
This induces a genetic correlation between the traits. 
This is perhaps the most worrying of the causes for a genetic correlation, in that in this case there is no causal connection between the variant and both traits. 
</p>

How to determine the relative contributions of these latter two causes of genetic correlation? 
Family studies could help. 
Also would be useful to have some theory about what parameter regimes could potentially lead to signals; this could be compared to observations in humans.
