With the availability of genomic data on large cohorts of well-phenotyped individuals, there has been an increased interest in "genetic correlations" between traits. 
That is, when testing a set of genetic variants for association with two traits, are the effects of these genetic variants on the two traits correlated? 
</p>
<p>
These are now simple, easy-to-use software packages for calculating
these genetic correlations (<a
href="https://github.com/bulik/ldsc">e.g.</a>), and it is now clear
that many traits show some evidence for genetic correlation.
For example,  LDL cholesterol and risk of
coronary artery disease are genetically correlated (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18193043">e.g.</a>). The most obvious interpretation of
a genetic correlation is that it arises as  a result of pleiotropy [1]--alleles
that affect one trait on average also have an affect on a second trait. 
This intepretation can shed powerful light on the shared genetic basis
of phenotypes, and can also allow the dissection of casual
relationships among phenotypes (through approaches such as <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-genom-090314-050016">Mendelian randomization</a>). 
Increasingly we will be faced with genetic correlations that are
complex to understand and may have multiple casual underpinnings: for example, <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i582">height is genetically correlated to socioecomonic status</a>, and <a href="http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2015225a.html">educational attainment is negatively genetically correlated to body mass index</a>.

</p> 

<p>
Often when these genetic correlations are described they are simply referred to as
correlations; this avoids the issue of specifying how
they arise.
In some cases,though, genetic correlations are directly referred to
as pleiotropy. However, quantative geneticists have known
for a long time that genetic correlations arise for a variety of
related reasons [REF?]. It is tempting to see the genetic correlations found
by GWAS approaches as side-stepping these long-discussed issues. Indeed, if done well
they can indeed bypass the shared environment concerns that always
dogged family-based assessments of genetic correlations. However, the
deeper issue that genetic correlations can arise through parental
effects and assortative mating has perhaps not gone away.

<p>
<b>In this post, we want to discuss some of the possible interpretations of a genetic correlation.</b> We start with the two most common interpretations (putting aside obvious technical artifacts like shared population statification), and then discuss two additional possibilities, rarely directly tested, that merit further investigation.
</p>

<p>
1. "Biological" pleiotropy. In this situation, genetic variants that influence one trait also influence another because of some shared underlying biology. For example, genetic variants that influence age at menarche in women have correlated effects on male pattern baldness. Presumably this is because there are some shared hormonal pathways that influence both of these traits, such that altering these pathways has effects on multiple traits. 
</p>

<p>
2. "Mediated" pleiotropy. In this situation, one traits is directly causally influenced by another. This of course means that any genetic variant that influences the first phenotype will have knock-on effects on the second. The classic example here is LDL cholesterol and heart disease: these two traits are postively genetically correlated, and it is now widely accepted that this correlation is due to a causal effect of LDL on risk of developing disease. Identifying this situation is has important medical implications: since LDL is causal for heart disease, then any intervention that influences LDL (for example, a drug or an altered diet) should have an effect on someone's risk of heart disease. 
</p>


<p>
These two explanations of a genetic correlation are of course plausible. Some other models also seem quite plausible; the relative importance of these different models remains to be seen. 
</p>
<p>
3. Parental effects. For example, imagine that more educated parents pay more attention to the diets of their children, and thus their children have lower rates of obesity.
This would be detected as a genetic correlation between educational attainment and obesity, though the causal connection between the variant and the two traits is less direct than in the previous two situations. 
Example: folate levels and neural tube defects? NICE EG. WE COULD ALSO
INCLUDE ONE (e.g. made up) THAT'S more obviously mediated through the
parental external environment.

</p>

<p>
4. Assortative mating. For example, imagine more educated individuals tend to
marry individuals with lower BMI. This induces a genetic correlation
between the traits. What is happening is that the alleles that associated with both
traits co-occur in the same individuals (the offspring of these
assortative mating parents). This induced a form of linkage disequibrium
between the loci underlying the same traits (even if the loci are not
genetically linked). If assortative mating
continues over multiple generations this effect can build to an
equilibrium level of genetic correlation between the two traits (Crow
and Kimura).
</p>

How to determine the relative contributions of these latter two causes of genetic correlation? 
Family studies could help.
GRAHAM say: there was a height study you tweeted that did this.
Also would be useful to have some theory about what parameter regimes could potentially lead to signals; this could be compared to observations in humans. 

Note that while we have explained all of these effects in terms of
genetic covariance, they can also contribute to inflating the additive
genetic variance contributed by a trait. For example, couples
assortative mate by height, therefore, alleles contributing to tallness tend to be present
in taller individuals even more than we would predict from their
'true' effect size. Therefore, the effect sizes of alleles may be
mildly overestimated by this effect. 

<p>
---
[1] Note that the pleiotropy we see as quantitative geneticists can be
mediated through environmental effects. It is simply a statement that
alleles affect multiple traits, not that those shared effects have
simple "molecular" basis.
